# YunaVirtualTrainer

This is my project for my bachelor degree.

This is Yuna. She helps people which are in the recovery period.

She was created with MakeHuman 1.1.1.

I added the materials from make human in blender.

Yuna can walk now in blender and now I am tring to teach her to walk in unity, in this moment I have a bug on materials

TODO Create exercise animations.

The goal is that Yuna will give stars to the end users, which are copying her moves using kinect.
