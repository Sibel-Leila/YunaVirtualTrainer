# YunaVirtualTrainer

This is my project for my bachelor degree.

This is Yuna. She helps people which are in the recovery period.

She was created with MakeHuman version 1.1.1.

I added the android with materials from make human in blender tocreate the animations.

In blender Yuna can 
- walk
- make hip exercises
- arms exercises
- squats exercises

Yuna was expoted to format fbx format.

In Unity I created the fitness room using materials and objects from asset store.

I put the avatar in the middle of the room and added a colider from fbx.

TODO to detect the moves of the user using the rotation of the bones and comparing those with rotation of Yuna's bones

The goal is that Yuna will give stars to the end users, which are copying her moves using kinect.
