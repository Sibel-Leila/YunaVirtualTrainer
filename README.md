# YunaVirtualTrainer

This is my project for my bachelor degree.

This is Yuna. She helps people which are in the recovery period.

She was created with MakeHuman version 1.1.1.

I added the android with materials from make human in blender tocreate the animations.

In blender Yuna can 
- walk
- make hip exercises
- arms exercises
- squats exercises

Yuna was expoted to format fbx format.

In Unity I created the fitness room using materials and objects from asset store.

I put the avatar in the middle of the room and added a colider from fbx.

Using Kinect's API, I detected the body of user.

I verified if the rotation for user's bones are approximately same as Yuna»õs.

In 30 seconds, the user must copy the moves of the trainer.

After thos 30 seconds, Yuna will tell how well did you do it.
